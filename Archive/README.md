## 🎯 Purpose

This archive serves multiple purposes:

1. **Development History**: Preserves the iterative development process
2. **Reproducibility**: Enables recreation of experiments and results
3. **Learning Resource**: Documents the research and experimentation journey
4. **Backup**: Maintains copies of important development artifacts
5. **Reference**: Provides examples and baseline implementations

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Not for Production**: Files in this archive are for reference and development purposes only
- **Version Control**: These may be older versions or experimental implementations
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure any real medical data complies with privacy regulations
- **Dependencies**: Some scripts may require specific library versions or configurations
